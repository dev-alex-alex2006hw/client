## planet-client

A JavaScript client for [Planet's imagery API](https://www.planet.com/docs/).

### Installation

The `planet-client` package can be installed with `npm` (which comes with [Node](https://nodejs.org/)).  To add the package as a dependency to your project, run the following:

    npm install planet-client --save

### Use

The `planet-client` package can be used in a Node based project or in the browser with a CommonJS module loader (like [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)).

The library requires a global [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) implementation.  This comes with Node >= 0.12 and [modern browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=promise).  To use `planet-client` in an environment without `Promise`, you can [use a polyfill](https://www.google.com/search?q=promise+polyfill).

### Contributing

To get set up, clone the repository and install the development dependencies:

    git clone git@github.com:planetlabs/planet-client-js.git
    cd planet-client-js
    npm install

Run the tests to ensure any changes meet the coding style and maintain the expected functionality:

    npm test

During development, you can start a file watcher that runs the linter and tests with any file changes:

    npm start
